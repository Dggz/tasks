Operations service

Before you run, make sure you have PostgreSQL and Docker installed and running on your machine.
You can run the service using Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file is already configured to set up the PostgreSQL database and the operations service.

To run the service, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start the service and the database:
```bash
    docker-compose up --build
