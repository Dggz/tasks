Operations service

Before you run, make sure you have PostgreSQL and Docker installed and running on your machine.
You can run the service using Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file is already configured to set up the PostgreSQL database and the operations service.

To run the service, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to start the service and the database:

 - docker-compose up --build
After the services are up and running, you can access the operations service at `http://localhost:8080/docs`.
